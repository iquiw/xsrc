<Title>What and Where is X11R7&relvers;?</Title>

<Para>
The X.Org Foundation X11R&relvers; is an Open Source version of
the X Window System that supports
several UNIX(R) and UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux, the BSDs
and Solaris x86) on Intel and other platforms.

<Title>Configuring X for Your Hardware</Title>

<Para>
The <Literal remap="tt">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</Literal> file tells the X server what kind of
monitor,
video card and mouse you have.  You <Emphasis>must</Emphasis> create it to tell the
server what specific hardware you have.
</Para>

<Para>
You'll need info on your hardware:

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Your mouse type, baud rate and its /dev entry.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
The video card's chipset (e.g. ATI Radeon, nVidia GeForce 4/MX etc).
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Your monitor's sync frequencies.
</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
The recommended way to generate an <Literal remap="tt">xorg.conf</Literal> file is to use the
<Literal remap="tt">xorgcfg</Literal> utility.  The xorgconfig text utility is still there
for the (few) cases where xorgcfg can't be used. Also, there is a
sample file installed as <Literal remap="tt">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xorg.conf.eg</Literal>,
which can be used as a starting point.
</Para>

<Para>
For details about the <Literal remap="tt">xorg.conf</Literal> file format, refer to the
<Emphasis><ULink
URL="xorg.conf.5.html"
>xorg.conf(5)</ULink
></Emphasis> manual page.
</Para>

<Para>
Once you've set up a xorg.conf file, you can fine tune the video
modes with the <Literal remap="tt">xvidtune</Literal> utility.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>About mouse configuration</Title>

<Para>
X11R&relvers; has support for the mouse driver included in
the new <Emphasis remap="bf">wscons</Emphasis> console driver.
Specify ``<Literal remap="tt">wsmouse</Literal>'' as the protocol and
``<Literal remap="tt">/dev/wsmouse</Literal>'' as the  device in <Literal remap="tt">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</Literal>
with a PS/2 or USB mouse.
</Para>

<Para>
See <ULink
URL="mouse.html"
>README.mouse</ULink
>  for general
instruction on mouse configuration.

<Title>Running X</Title>

<Sect2>
<Title>Starting xdm, the display manager</Title>

<Para>
To start the display manager, log in as root on the console and type:
``<Literal remap="tt">xdm -nodaemon</Literal>''.
</Para>

<Para>
You can start xdm automatically on bootup by adding the line:

<Screen>
xdm_flags=""            # for normal use: xdm_flags=""
</Screen>

in <Literal remap="tt">/etc/rc.conf.local</Literal>.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Running X without the display manager</Title>

<Para>
The easiest way for new users to start X windows is to type: ``<Literal remap="tt">startx
&#62;&amp; startx.log</Literal>''.  Error messages are lost unless you redirect them
because the server takes over the screen.
</Para>

<Para>
To get out of X windows, type: ``<Literal remap="tt">exit</Literal>'' in the console xterm.
You can customize your X by creating <Literal remap="tt">.xinitrc</Literal>, <Literal remap="tt">.xserverrc</Literal>,
and <Literal remap="tt">.twmrc</Literal> files in your home directory as described in the xinit
and startx man pages.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Kernel Support for X</Title>

<Para>
OpenBSD's GENERIC kernels have all support for running X enabled.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>Console drivers</Title>

<Para>
The server supports wscons, the standard OpenBSD/i386 console driver.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>Aperture Driver</Title>

<Para>
By default OpenBSD includes the BSD 4.4 kernel security
feature that disables access to the <Literal remap="tt">/dev/mem</Literal> device when in
multi-user mode. But the X server requires
linear access to the display memory in most cases.
</Para>

<Para>
OpenBSD requires the aperture driver to be enabled for all X
servers, because the aperture driver also controls access to the
I/O ports of the video boards.
</Para>

<Para>
To enable the aperture driver, once included in the kernel, set

<Screen>
machdep.allowaperture=2
</Screen>

in <Literal remap="tt">/etc/sysctl.conf</Literal>.  See the
<ULink
URL="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xf86&#38;apropos=0&#38;sektion=4&#38;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&#38;arch=i386&#38;format=html"
>xf86(4)</ULink
>
manual page for details.
</Para>

<Para>
Another (less recommended) way to enable linear memory and I/O ports
access is to disable the kernel security feature by
initializing <Literal remap="tt">securelevel</Literal> to -1 in <Literal remap="tt">/etc/rc.securelevel</Literal>.
</Para>

<Para>
<QUOTE
><Emphasis remap="bf">Caveat:</Emphasis> the aperture driver only allows one access at a time
(so that the system is in the same security state once X is
launched). This means that if you run multiple servers on multiple
virtual terminals, only the first one will have linear memory access.
Set <Literal remap="tt">securelevel</Literal> to -1 if you need more that one X server at a time.</QUOTE
>
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>MIT-SHM</Title>

<Para>
OpenBSD supports System V shared memory. If X
detects this support in your kernel, it will support the MIT-SHM
extension.
</Para>

</Sect2>

</Sect1>

<Sect1>
<Title>Rebuilding the X Distribution</Title>

<Para>

Note that OpenBSD project now has its own source tree,
with some local modifications. You may want
to start with this tree to rebuild from sources.  The OpenBSD XF4
source tree is available by anoncvs from all OpenBSD anoncvs
servers. See <ULink
URL="http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html"
>http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</ULink
> for details on anoncvs.
</Para>

<Para>
<Anchor id="otherarch" xreflabel="Building on other architectures">
</Para>

<Para>
X11R&relvers; compiles on most OpenBSD architectures. The X.Org
X server builds and run on the following systems. On other
architectures supported by OpenBSD, only client side libraries and
applications are supported.
</Para>

<Sect2>
<Title>OpenBSD/alpha</Title>

<Para>
The X server is known to work on some VGA cards in alpha
machines that support BWX I/O, with OpenBSD 3.2 and higher.
</Para>

<Para>
The following cards have been successfully tested for now:

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>

<Para>
3DLabs Permedia 2 (8, 15, 16 and 24 bits depth)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
ATI Rage Pro (works with 'Option "NoAccel"')
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Cirrus Logic CL5430 (works with 'Option "NoAccel"')
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Cirrus Logic GD5446 (8, 16 and 24 bits depth)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>

<Para>
Matrox MGA 2064 (8, 16 and 24 bits depth)
</Para>
</ListItem>

</ItemizedList>

</Para>

<Para>
Note that this version of doesn't work on TGA cards. The
version shipped with OpenBSD 3.1 and higher includes an OS-specific
driver <Emphasis>wsfb</Emphasis> that is used to support TGA cards.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>OpenBSD/macppc</Title>

<Para>
The X server is currently known to work on most of the G4 Macs and
iBooks with ATI or nVidia cards.
Other machines are more or less untested.
</Para>

<Para>
Use xorgconfig to build a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file before starting
the server for the first time.
</Para>

<Para>
For the Titanium Powerbook G4, you can try the following mode line in
<Literal remap="tt">/etc/X11/xorg.conf</Literal> to match the flat panel resolution:
</Para>

<Para>

<Screen>
Modeline "1152x768" 64.995 1152 1213 1349 1472  768 771 777 806 -HSync -VSync
</Screen>

</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>OpenBSD/sparc</Title>

<Para>
OpenBSD 3.2 on sparc switched to the wscons device driver and now uses
the OS specific <Emphasis>wsfb</Emphasis> driver in the X server. This driver is
not included in X11R&relvers;. Please use the version shipped with
OpenBSD instead.
</Para>

</Sect2>

<Sect2>
<Title>OpenBSD/sparc64</Title>

<Para>
This version only has support PCI based machines using ATI cards on
OpenBSD/sparc64. Note that the version shipped with OpenBSD has
support for the X server on both SBus and UPA (unaccelerated) based cards.
</Para>
