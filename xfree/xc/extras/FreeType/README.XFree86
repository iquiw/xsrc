Those files have been slightly modified.  All the changes are marked

When importing version A.B of FreeType, use:

 cvs import -m "FreeType version A.B" xc/extras/FreeType FreeType FreeType-A_B


Files that are modified relative to the most recent import should have
the ident text: $XFree86: xc/extras/FreeType/README.XFree86,v 1.2 1998/09/06 05:05:29 dawes Exp $ added in a comment.
