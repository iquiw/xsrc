This will attempt to load a .bdf font into wsdisplay, to be used with
wsconsctl -dw font=<name>
Caveats:
- fonts wider than 16 pixels won't work yet
- the program does not distinguish between monospace and proportional fonts,
  and terminal output is necessarily monospace. Proportional fonts should
  work but the glyphs will be left justified in the character cell so things
  will look uneven.
- some drivers may have trouble with font widths that are not a multiple of 4
- no attempt has been made to make this play nice with vga text mode
