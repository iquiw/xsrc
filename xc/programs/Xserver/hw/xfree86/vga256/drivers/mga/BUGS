BUG 0001

Opened:		14/10/96
Closed: 
Reported by:	Andrew Vanderstock (vanderaj@mail2.svhm.org.au)
Fixed by:

Problem: can't start the XF86_SVGA driver due to "no PCI bus found"

Workaround: run scanpci and then try starting the server again.

Discussion:

I've noticed that on my HP Vectra VT 6/150 with 2 MB OEM board, it may not
find the PCI bus, and try out the OTI SVGA chipset that might be lurking in
there. 

Solution:

We need to check the PCI detection code to get rid of this bug. scanpci
is doing it right, and leaving it in the right state, so we should use that.

BUG 0002

Opened: 	14/10/96
Closed: 	
Reported by:	Andrew Vanderstock
Fixed by:	

Problem: no lines appear when you drag a window in 32 bpp at 800*600 
using fvwm

Workaround: none known at this time

Solution: have a look at the 32 bpp line drawing code and check if the
alpha channel or something is causing the line not to be drawn.

BUG 0003

Opened: 	14/10/96

Reported by:	Andrew Vanderstock (vanderaj@mail2.svhm.org.au)
Fixed by:

Problem: GIF image scaling problem in arena (a web browser that comes with
RedHat Commercial Linux 2.1) in 16 and 32 bpp modes (and probably 24 bpp)

Workaround:  none at this time. Use xv if you need to see it properly

discussion: I've looked through the code, and we're not using ILOAD bitblts yet
this looks as if the bitblt is being constantly done over and over again.
It needs further attention. xv does not do the same thing, and displays
the image properly.

Solution: more code hacking

BUG 0004

Opened: 	14/10/96
Closed:
Reported by: 	Andrew Vanderstock (vanderaj@mail2.svhm.org.au)
Fixed by:

Problem: can't get any 24 bpp mode to work on 2 MB OEM 175 MHz configuration,
it fatal errors with "MGA: Can't display more than 2 MB with this display 
width".

Workaround: none yet

Discussion: I've been poking around, and we need to check the rounding
on 2 mb (non-interleaved) 24 bpp modes. Does anyone need a dump of something
so we can get this one sorted?

Solution: none yet.

BUG 0005

Opened: 	14/10/96
Closed:
Reported by:	Andrew Vanderstock (vanderaj@mail2.svhm.org.au)
Fixed by:	

Problem:	some lines in xterms are not being drawn properly, where the
		first character may have the last 5 scan lines not drawn, and
		then then next character may have only 4, the next 3 until it
		appears as per normal. This is only evident on 16 and 32 bpp
		modes so far. Try using "less" and watch your prompt down the
		bottom being eaten by the line lossage.

Workaround:	refresh the screen

Discussion:	huh?

Solution: 	more code hacking required.
