XFree driver for NVidia/SGS-Thomson RIVA128
===========================================

This driver now accelerates bitblits,filled rectangles and colour expansion.
It also support a hardware cursor.

Note that requesting 16bpp actually gives 15bpp. This is because the RIVA128
cannot accelerate many functions at 565 colour depth. If you put 
"option noaccel" in the config file then 565 will be available - but without 
acceleration of course.

Known Bugs
==========

* Pixel noise at high resolution in 32bpp

Thanks
======

Also many thanks to Curtis,Dwight and Don at Nvidia for their help and support.

Update

Video noise fixed.  Also disabled mono expansion code.  Should be faster
on higher end machines.
