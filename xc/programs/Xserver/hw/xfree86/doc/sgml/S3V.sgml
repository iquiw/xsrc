<title> Information for S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX Users

<sect> Supported hardware
<p>
The current XF86_S3V server supports S3 ViRGE (86C325) and 
S3 ViRGE/VX (86C988) chips.  32bpp TrueColor and External RAMDACs for 
ViRGE/VX are not yet supported.  It has been tested with ViRGE cards with
2 and 4MB DRAM and with a 220MHz ViRGE/VX card with 2MB VRAM up to 
1600x1200 with 8/15/16bpp.

NOTE: This driver is pretty new, and not everything might work like you expect
it to. It shouldn't crash your machine, but you may have video artifacts
or missing lines. Please report any and all problems to
<htmlurl name="XFree86@Xfree86.org" url="mailto:XFree86@Xfree86.org">
using the appropriate bug report sheet. 

There will be updated drivers in the coming XFree86 beta releases. 

<sect>Features:
<p>

<itemize>
<item> Basic support for S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX video adapters
<item> uses linear frame buffer
<item> it should be possible to reach resolutions up to 2048x2048
<item> it should be possible to use pixel depths of 8, 15, and 16 
  (24/32 not yet) bits
  per pixel.
</itemize>

<sect>Future Features (in order from highest to lowest priority)
<p>

<itemize>
<item>	support of 24/32bpp
<item>	some more hardware acceleration
<item>	3d acceleration (once we work out how that's done)
<item>  more chipsets and RAMDACs
</itemize>

<sect>Configuration:
<p>

The server auto-detects RAM size, RAMDAC and ClockChip. Do not bother putting 
these in your "Device" section. 
The "nolinear" option is unsupported.
