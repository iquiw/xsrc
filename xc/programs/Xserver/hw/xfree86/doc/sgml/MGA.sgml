<sect>Supported hardware
<p>
The current MGA driver in the SVGA server supports the Matrox Millennium 
(MGA2064W) with Ti3026 RAMDAC. It has been tested with 175, 220MHz, and
250MHz cards with 2MB, 4MB and 8MB WRAM. It supports the Matrox Mystique
with 170 and 220 MHz RAMDACs.

There is experimental support for the Matrox
Millennium II, which for the most part works, but DO NOT USE THIS ON PRODUCTION
SYSTEMS - it is no where near tested enough for that role. We do not yet have
the card's documentation, so this is a alpha quality addition - test this support
at your own risk.

This version of the server does not support the rev 3 Matrox Millennium I. 

NOTE: This driver is pretty new, and not everything works like you expect
it to. It shouldn't crash your machine, but you may have video artifacts
or missing lines. Please report any and all problems to
<htmlurl name="XFree86@Xfree86.org" url="mailto:XFree86@Xfree86.org">
using the appropriate bug report sheet. 

<sect>Features:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Basic support for the Matrox Millennium video adapter

<itemize>
<item>uses linear frame buffer
<item>it should be possible to reach resolutions up to 1920x1024
<item>it should be possible to use pixel depths of 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits
  per pixel (256 pseudo colour, "high colour", "packed true colour",
  "true colour"). 
<item>supports VESA Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS)
<item>supports RGB Sync-on-Green
<item>supports DGA
<item>has the following accelerations:
<itemize>
  <item>lines
  <item>most bitblts
  <item>filled rectangles
  <item>cached pixmaps
  <item>many more...
</itemize>
The Millennium server is fairly well accelerated, and is one of the fastest
XFree86 3.3.1 Xservers. Future work will concentrate on fixing
remaining bugs.
</itemize>

<item>Basic support for the Matrox Mystique video adapter
<itemize>
<item>uses linear frame buffer
<item>it should be possible to reach resolutions up to 1280x1024
<item>it should be possible to use pixel depths of 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits
  per pixel (256 pseudo colour, "high colour", "packed true colour",
  "true colour"). 
<item>supports VESA Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS)
<item>has the following accelerations (may be with some bugs):
<itemize>
  <item>lines
  <item>most bitblts
  <item>filled rectangles
  <item>cached pixmaps
  <item>NOTE: If acceleration do not work properly, you had rather to insert:
Option "noaccel" 
line in the Device section of XF86Config file. It will be slower but will work better.
</itemize>
</itemize>
</itemize>

<itemize>Experimental Support for the Matrox Millennium II
<item>Provided ONLY as a test and to provide early access to Mill II owners
<item>Works as if it is a Millennium I
<item>We don't have the card's tech docs yet, so no specific Mill II speedups
<item>Has plenty of bugs:
<itemize>
  <item>May corrupt your text font when you exit X
  <item>May not work correctly at 24 bpp
  <item>Lots more where that came from... :-)
</itemize>
</itemize>


<sect>Future Features (in order from highest to lowest priority)
<p>

<itemize>
<item>more hardware acceleration (more primitive operations, etc)
<item>hw cursor for Mystique board
<item>more chipsets and RAMDACs
<item>3D acceleration using Mesa
</itemize>

<sect>Technical Note:
<p>

This driver only supports:
<itemize>
<item>the MGA Storm (MGA2064W) chipset with the TI
(TVP) 3026 RAMDAC. Matrox have only so far made 175, 220 and 250 MHz boards
with these two components, although a 135 MHz RAMDAC part exists.

<item>the MGA Storm (MGA1064SG) chipset with integrated 170 and 220 MHz RAMDAC

<item>the MGA Storm (MGA2164W) chipset with the TI TVP 3026 RAMDAC. This is experimental 

<item>We will eventually provide support for the other Matrox chipsets (once the
Millennium driver is at a far enough stage and more people with other cards
join the effort), including the Impression, Atlas, Genesis etc. 

At the moment, however, only the Millennium and Mystique are supported.
</itemize>

<sect>Configuration:
<p>

The server auto-detects WRAM size and RAMDAC speed. Do not bother putting 
these in your "Device" section, as they will be overridden. The TVP3026 and MGA1064SG have a programmable clock generator, so probing and setting clocks is unnecessary as
well.

The "nolinear" option is not a valid option for the MGA server.
The driver now ignores this directive.

The options "noaccel" or "no_bitblt" turn off BitBlt Engine and other
accelerated functions.

<sect>Known solutions for some problems:
<p>

<itemize>
<item>the driver doesn't support some values of HTotal parameter in
Modelines in the XF86Config file. If you get flickering vertical stripes on
the screen, try to change this parameter +/- 8.
