<sect>Supported hardware
<p>
The current MGA driver in the SVGA server supports 
<p>
<itemize>
<item>Matrox Millennium 
(MGA2064W) with Ti3026 RAMDAC. It has been tested with 175, 220MHz, and
250MHz cards with 2MB, 4MB and 8MB WRAM. 
<item>Millennium II both PCI and AGP. It has been tested with up to 16MB RAM.
<item>Matrox Mystique
with 170 and 220 MHz RAMDACs. Both 1064SG and 1164SG should work.
</itemize>

<sect>Features:
<p>
<itemize>
<item>uses linear frame buffer
<item>it should be possible to reach resolutions up to 1920x1024
<item>it should be possible to use pixel depths of 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits
  per pixel (256 pseudo colour, "high colour", "packed true colour",
  "true colour"). 
<item>supports VESA Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS)
<item>supports RGB Sync-on-Green
<item>supports DGA
<item>full accelerations:
</itemize>
This server is very well accelerated, and is one of the fastest
XFree86 3.3.2 Xservers. Future work will concentrate on fixing
remaining bugs.

<sect>Technical Note:
<p>

This driver only supports:
<itemize>
<item>the MGA Storm (MGA2064W) chipset with the TI
(TVP) 3026 RAMDAC. Matrox have only so far made 175, 220 and 250 MHz boards
with these two components, although a 135 MHz RAMDAC part exists.

<item>the MGA Storm (MGA1064SG) chipset with integrated 170 and 220 MHz RAMDAC

<item>the MGA Storm (MGA1164SG) chipset with integrated 170 and 220 MHz RAMDAC

<item>the MGA Storm (MGA2164W) chipset with the TI TVP 3026 RAMDAC. 

<item>We are still interested to provide support for the other Matrox chipsets 
including the Impression, Atlas, Genesis etc. but at this time have not been 
able to obtain the docs for them.

</itemize>

<sect>Configuration:
<p>

The server auto-detects WRAM size and RAMDAC speed. Do not bother putting 
these in your "Device" section, as they will be overridden. The TVP3026 and MGA1064SG have a programmable clock generator, so probing and setting clocks is unnecessary as
well.

The "nolinear" option is not a valid option for the MGA server.
The driver now ignores this directive.

The options "noaccel" or "no_bitblt" turn off BitBlt Engine and other
accelerated functions.

<sect>Known solutions for some problems:
<p>

<itemize>
<item>the driver doesn't support some values of HTotal parameter in
Modelines in the XF86Config file. If you get flickering vertical stripes on
the screen, try to change this parameter +/- 8.
<item>On some Millennium II cards the driver shows severe distortions with 
24bpp in modes above about 1024x768. We hope to have automated the detection
and fix of this problem. If it still occurs, please use Option "mga_24bpp_fix"
in the Device Section to get a stable picture.
