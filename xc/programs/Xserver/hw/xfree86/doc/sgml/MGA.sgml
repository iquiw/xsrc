<sect> Supported hardware
<p>
The current MGA driver in the SVGA server supports the Matrox Millennium 
(MGA2064W) with Ti3026 RAMDAC. It has been tested with 175 and 220MHz cards
with 2 and 4MB WRAM. 

NOTE: This driver is pretty new, and not everything works like you expect
it to. It shouldn't crash your machine, but you may have video artifacts
or missing lines. Please report any and all problems to
<htmlurl name="XFree86@Xfree86.org" url="mailto:XFree86@Xfree86.org">
using the appropriate bug report sheet. 

There will be updated drivers in the coming XFree86 beta releases. 

<sect>Features:
<p>

<itemize>
<item> Basic support for the Matrox Millennium video adapter
<item> uses linear frame buffer
<item> it should be possible to reach resolutions up to 1920x1024
<item> it should be possible to use pixel depths of 8, 16, 24, and 32 bits
  per pixel (256 pseudo colour, "high colour", "packed true colour",
  "true colour"). 
<item> has the following accelerations:
<itemize>
  <item> lines
  <item> some bitblts
  <item> filled rectangles
</itemize>
</itemize>

Acceleration is in its early stages, the driver is far from utilizing the
full potential of the MGA chipset. Especially in higher color depths, the
server is rather slow. Work on this is being done, so expect significant
improvements in the upcoming beta releases.

<sect>Future Features (in order from highest to lowest priority)
<p>

<itemize>
<item>	more hardware acceleration (hw cursor, more primitive operations, etc)
<item>	3d acceleration (once we work out how that's done)
<item>  more chipsets and RAMDACs
</itemize>

<sect>Technical Note:
<p>

This driver is based on the work of Radoslaw Kapitan for the most part. It
was done while he did not have the required Matrox documentation. The driver 
has been cleaned up and corrected, and additional accelerated features have
been added. It should work on most Matrox Millennium boards.

This driver only supports the MGA Storm (MGA2064W) chipset with the TI
(TVP) 3026 RAMDAC. Matrox have only so far made 175 and 220 MHz boards with
these two components, although 135 and 250 MHz RAMDAC parts exist.

We will eventually provide support for the other Matrox chipsets (once the
Millennium driver is at a far enough stage and more people with other cards
join the effort), including the Impression, Mystique, etc. 

At the moment, however, only the Millennium is supported.

<sect>Configuration:
<p>

The server auto-detects WRAM size and RAMDAC speed. Do not bother putting 
these in your "Device" section, as they will be overridden. The TVP3026 has a
programmable clock generator, so probing and setting clocks is unnecessary as
well.

The "nolinear" option is currently unsupported

The options "noaccel" or "no_bitblt" turn off BitBlt Engine and other
accelerated functions.
