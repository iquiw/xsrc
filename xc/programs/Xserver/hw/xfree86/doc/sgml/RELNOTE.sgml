 <author>The XFree86 Project, Inc
 <date>4 August 1997

<abstract>

This document describes the bugs fixed in XFree86 3.3.1 compared with the
3.3 release, as well as the new features in XFree86 3.3 compared with the
previous full release, 3.2.  It also includes installation instructions
for the binary distributions.

</abstract>

<toc>

<sect> XFree86 and X11R6.3
<p>
XFree86 releases starting with the 3.2A beta are based on the
X Consortium's X11R6.3 (the final release from the X Consortium).

R6.3 is an update to R6.1, and is intended to be compatible with R6.1
and R6 at the source and protocol levels.  Binaries should be
upward-compatible.  X11R6.3 includes some new Xserver extensions:
SECURITY, XC-APPGROUP, XpExtension (print extension), and an updated,
and standardised version of LBX.  X11R6.3 also has new standards,
including RX (X Remote Execution MIME type), and a proxy management
protocol.  X11R6.3 includes support for gzipped fonts.

R6.1 is an update to R6,
and is intended to be compatible with R6 at the source and protocol
levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.  X11R6.1 includes some
new Xserver extensions: DOUBLE-BUFFER, XKEYBOARD and RECORD.

What about R6.2?  X11R6.2 is the name given to a subset of X11R6.3,
which has only the print extension and the Xlib implementation of
vertical writing and user-defined character support in addition to
those features included in R6.1.
<p>
<sect> OS issues
<p>
Always check the OS specific README files for special requirements or caveats. 
<p>
Users running Linux/Elf (on Intel platforms) should note that they will
need ld.so version 1.7.14 or later.  This
can be found at <htmlurl name="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC"
url="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC">.
<p>
Note: Elf is now the only binary type supported for Linux OSs.  This means
that binaries for ix86/a.out and AXP/ECOFF are not available with this
release.

</itemize>
<sect1>Known Problems
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>There are problems with some Cirrus laptop chipsets (75xx).  The
	driver seems to work for some people, but not others.  Until
	someone with the appropriate hardware can look into
	this, these problems are unlikely to be fixed.  If you wish to
	work on this, please contact us.  We don't need testers, we need
	people willing and able to fix the problems.
  <item>There are problems with some of the Trident laptop chipsets.  The
	driver seems to work in a limited way for some people, but not
	others.  Until someone with the appropriate hardware can look into
	this, these problems are unlikely to be fixed.  If you wish to
	work on this, please contact us.  We don't need testers, we need
	people willing and able to fix the problems.
  <item>We have had some reports of apparently random lockups with some
	Mystique cards.  We have not been able to reproduce this problem,
	and have no fix for it.
  <item>There is a drawing bug in the MGA driver that shows up when running
	`viewfax'.  We have no fix for this problem yet.
  <item>Some people have reported problems with some newer Rage II cards.
	We have no fix for this problem yet.
  <item>We've had a report that the SVGA server will cause a lockup on
	some SVR4 versions (UnixWare 1.x) with some Chips and Technologies
	chips.  A workaround for this problem is to use the "xaa_no_color_exp"
	option.

	relatively complete acceleration, at different colour depths,
	for several chips in the SVGA server.  Chips currently making use
	of this include the Matrox Millennium, Mystique, Tseng ET4000/W32p
	and ET6000,
	and several chips from ARK Logic, Chips and Technologies, Cirrus,
	Trident, SiS and the S3 ViRGE family.
  <item>The SVGA server now includes a driver for the S3 ViRGE family. It 
        supports the ViRGE, ViRGE/DX, ViRGE/GX and ViRGE/VX. This driver is
        a completely new implementation, so please send in success/failure
        reports.

  <item>The line drawing code has been improved.
  <item>Packed 24bpp support is included, and should be improved
	over earlier versions.
  <item>The S3V server translates between sparse 32bpp pixmaps and packed
	24bpp for the framebuffer.  In some cases this can be slow.
  <item>32bpp framebuffer format is not supported.
</itemize>
<sect1> Mach64 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for 3D Rage II based Mach64 cards is included.
  <item>Various problems with support for some revisions of CT, VT and GT

	3D Rage II based Mach64 cards upgrade to the 3.3 release due
	to the problems that were fixed.
</itemize>
<sect1> Mach32 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>A bug that causes problems when running XF86Setup with cards with
	less than 2MB of video memory has been fixed.
  <item>Minor shifts in maximum clock rate under 16 bpp, and inclusion of
        explicit 15 "bpp" setting.
</itemize>
<sect1> W32 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>In this version, the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not
	undergone any significant changes. In fact, it is not being
	developed further. Instead, the SVGA server (XF86_SVGA) is now the
	main focus of new developments. See the W32 (SVGA) description.

<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Preliminary acceleration support is included, using XAA.
  <item>Various bugs have been fixed.
</itemize>
<sect1> Trident driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Acceleration support has been added for the 9320, 9440 and 96xx chips.
  <item>Support for the Cyber series of laptop chips has been improved.
  <item>24/32bpp support has been added for some chips.
  <item>Some clock limits have been fixed.
</itemize>
<sect1> Ark driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>More complete acceleration has been implemented using XAA,
	including line draw, fill, and text acceleration, at different
	colour depths.
</itemize>
<sect1> W32 driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The SVGA server now supports acceleration for the most recent
	ET4000W32 chips. In 3.3, the ET4000W32p chips are now fully
	accelerated, and also support the higher performing linear memory
	layout (read the tseng README file for more information: there are a
	few problems).
  <item>VESA DPMS (monitor power saving) support was added.
  <item>There is now support for more than 256 colors on most ET4000W32i and
	ET4000W32p chips. This means 15, 16, 24 and/or 32 bits per pixel
	modes (32768, 65536 or 16 million colors) are supported on most
	common RAMDACs. On the W32p, these modes are accelerated. On the
	W32i, there is no acceleration in any mode. For accelerated support
	on W32i chips, refer to the separate W32 server (XF86_W32).
  <item>A few bugs in XFree86 3.2 and 3.2A have been fixed. Most importantly
	the failure to probe some PCI cards has been resolved.
  <item>Fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards,
	floppy-tape drives)
  <item>Support for the Chrontel RAMDAC has been added.
</itemize>
<sect1> ET6000 driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The ET6000 driver in the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not
	changed significantly.
  <item>On the other hand, the ET6000 driver in the SVGA server, which
	already existed in XFree86 3.2 for all color depths, is now fully
	accelerated for all those color depths. It builds upon the new XAA
	architecture, which is the cornerstone of a new acceleration
	framework within the XFree86 servers. It is responsible for the
	outstanding acceleration performance of this release.
  <item>Many small problems which existed in the initial 3.2 release have
	been solved. Screen noise, flicker or instability at higher pixel
	clocks are mostly fixed. Some detection problems are gone. Weird
	behaviour (jumping and screen wrap) when panning through large
	virtual desktops has been fixed. The server now detects the correct
	amount of memory on ET6000 cards with 2.25 MB of MDRAM. More
	realistic pixel clock rate limits have been put in place, to avoid
	modes that would cause screen problems.
  <item>DPMS support was added.
  <item>The ET6000 hardware cursor is now supported. Read the Tseng
	documentation file for more information (there are a few
	limitations)
  <item>fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards,
	floppy-tape drives)
</itemize>
<sect1> Alliance ProMotion driver (SVGA server)
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>The driver now recognises the AT24 chipset, but it is treated
	the same way as the AP6422.

The following is required for new installations, and optional for existing
installations:
<quote>
<verb>
X331cfg.tgz     sample config files for xinit, xdm
</verb>
</quote>

NOTE: Be very careful about installing X331cfg.tgz over an existing
installation if you have customised your xinit and/or xdm config files.
Installing X331cfg.tgz will overwrite any existing files.  If you do have
customised files, there is no need to install X331cfg.tgz.

NOTE: The bitmap fonts distributed with this release are compressed using
gzip rather than compress.  This means that you will probably want to
remove the old versions (after backing them up).  The Xservers and font
server in releases prior to 3.2A cannot read gzipped fonts, so keep a copy
of the old fonts if you wish to run older servers.

The following X servers are for PC/AT based hardware (i.e., typical
Intel ix86 based PCs).  Choose at least one which
matches your hardware, as well as the VGA16 server.  The VGA16 server is
required by the new configuration utility (XF86Setup).

If you already have a version of XFree86 installed, <bf>MAKE A BACKUP OF</bf>
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> <bf>BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE</bf>.  The standard
installation procedure will overwrite your existing version of XFree86.

If you are installing from scratch, create a directory called
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, then extract the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files.
If you don't have enough space in <tt>/usr</tt> for this, create a
directory elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it.
E.g., if you create a directory in <tt>/home</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
	mkdir /home/X11R6
	ln -s /home/X11R6 /usr
</verb></tscreen>

The next step is to run the pre-installation script.  This script makes
some preliminary checks of your system.  For some OSs, it may tell you
to install new versions of some system components before proceeding with
the installation.  This script may also remove some outdated files and
symbolic links from a previous installation that could cause problems.

For the purposes of these installation instructions, it is assumed that
you have downloaded all the files to the <tt>/var/tmp</tt> directory.
If you've put them in another directory, that's fine -- just replace
all occurrences of ``<tt>/var/tmp</tt>'' with the name of that directory.

To run the pre-installation script, go to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and run it:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

The next step is to untar the installation utility.  To do this, make
sure the extract.tgz file is in the same directory as all the X331*.tgz
files, and run the following from that directory:

<tscreen><verb>
	cd /var/tmp
	gzip -d < extract.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>

The installation utility ``extract'' is used to unpack the .tgz files
that make up the XFree86 distribution.  The .tgz files are gzipped
tar files.  However, ``tar'' in its standard form on most OSs is not
well-suited to the task of installing XFree86.  The extract utility is
a modified version of GNU tar 1.12 built with the options required to
make it suitable for installing XFree86.  The source for extract is
available from the same place you got the XFree86 distribution.

It is strongly recommended that you use the provided extract utility to
unpack the XFree86 distribution.  If you choose to ignore this and use
something else, we don't want to hear from you if you run into problems.
It is also important that you do not rename the extract utility.  If
renamed, it behaves just like the normal GNU tar.

To extract the XFree86 binaries, run the following as <bf>root</bf>:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	/var/tmp/extract /var/tmp/X331*.tgz
</verb></tscreen>

Once the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files have been extracted, run the post
installation script:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/postinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

For OSs which use ldconfig, you may need to run ldconfig or reboot to
complete the installation.  The postinst.sh script should run ldconfig
correctly for you if you are using Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD.
For other OSs that use ldconfig, check how it normally gets run at boot time.
