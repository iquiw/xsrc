<sect> General Information about Beta Releases
<p>
This is a beta release of XFree86.  XFree86 beta releases are available
to the public in binary form only.  Source code is available only to
registered members of the XFree86 beta team.  The main reason for this
is that XFree86 beta versions often contain source code from other
sources (such as the X Consortium) which is not yet available for public
release.  If you want to test or work on these releases at the source
code level, you can apply for membership of the XFree86 beta team by
sending email to <htmlurl name="XFree86@XFree86.org"
url="mailto:XFree86@XFree86.org">.

The X servers included in beta releases have a built-in expiry date.
The reason for this is to try to prevent them from persisting beyond the
date of the next release, and to encourage people to test new beta releases.
The expiry date for 3.1.2G is 15 January 1997.

The XFree86 binary beta releases may be freely redistributed providing that
they are not modified in any way, and providing that an unmodified version
of this document and the BetaReport document is included with the distribution.

The reasons for making this beta release publicly available are to
give it the widest possible testing, and also to make support for
new hardware available.

The XFree86 Project encourages people to test this beta release, and to
send us a report.  We need both success and failure reports, and we also
need people using already supported hardware to test these beta releases
to make sure that we haven't broken anything while adding support for
new hardware.  A template for the Beta test reports can be found in the
file ``BetaReport'' which should be available from the same place you got
this file.  It is also installed in <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/</tt>.
Beta test reports should be sent to <htmlurl name="report@XFree86.org"
url="mailto:report@XFree86.org">.  Please do not send these reports to
our usual support address.

<url name="The XFree86 FAQ" url="http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ"> contains
a section about the current beta version.  It includes a regularly
updated list of known problems.  If you are having problems with the
current beta version, please look here first.

Note that much of the documentation provided with this release has not
been updated and still refers to 3.1.2.  If in doubt, check the date
shown in the file(s).

<sect> Who are the XFree86 Beta Releases Targeted At?
<p>
The XFree86 beta releases are intended for people who are prepared to
test software which might be unstable and which might be buggy, and report
the results of the testing.  These beta releases are not intended for
beginners, but for people who have a basic knowledge of the OS so that they
don't require much support for issues like upgrading system libraries and
obtaining necessary packages.

If you are going to test this software, you should be prepared for the
following:
<itemize>
  <item>Installation problems.  The installation procedure for beta releases
	gets only very limited testing prior to release.  You should be
	prepared for problems here, and you should be prepared to upgrade
	other components of your system if it proves necessary.  You should
	also have facilities to backup a previous installation (and
	preferably your entire system) so that it can be restored in case
	of serious problems.
  <item>New bugs.  Since each beta version gets only a limited amount of
	pre-release testing, it is likely that a new version will contain
	new bugs.  This is unavoidable, because any code change, be it
	fixing previous bugs or adding new features, brings with it the
	chance that new bugs have been introduced.  You should be prepared
	for the possibility that the new version will have problems with
	your hardware.  In this situation, you should first check the
	<url name="XFree86 FAQ" url="http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ"> to
	see if it is a known problem (possibly with a workaround), and then
	report the problem in detail.
  <item>Expiry date.  The XFree86 beta servers have a limited lifetime.
	Before using one, you should be aware of this and what the
	implications of this are.  If you have objections to software
	that has an expiry date, you shouldn't use this beta software.
	It is possible that when one version expires you may find that
	the replacement version has problems, or perhaps binaries of the
	replacement are not available for your OS.  If you depend on a
	server for your work/school/etc, you shouldn't be relying on
	this beta software.
</itemize>
-->

<sect> XFree86 and X11R6.1
<p>
XFree86 releases starting with the 3.1.2D beta are based on the X Consortium's
X11R6.1.

R6.1 is an update to R6,
and is intended to be compatible with R6 at the source and protocol
levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.  X11R6.1 includes some
new Xserver extensions: DOUBLE-BUFFER, XKEYBOARD and RECORD.  LBX has
been dropped from R6.1, and as such, has been dropped from XFree86 too.
It is expected that it will reappear in some form in a future release.
<p>
<sect> OS issues
<p>
Always check the OS specific README files for
special requirements or caveats. 
<p>
Users running Linux/Elf (on Intel platforms) should note that they will
need ld.so-1.7.14.  This
can be found at <url name="tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/packages/GCC"
url="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC">.

<sect> New Features in 3.2
<p>
Note, items marked with `*' have been added since the last beta release
(3.1.2G).
<p>
<sect1> General
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>XFree86 3.2 includes the X Consortium's X11R6.1.
  <item>XFree86-3.2 includes a full distribution for Linux/m68k.
  <item>XFree86-3.2 includes a full distribution for Linux/Alpha.
  <item>XFree86-3.2 includes a full distribution for OS/2.
</itemize>
<sect1> General X server changes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>A `DefaultColorDepth' keyword has been added for the Screen section
	in XF86Config files to allow the default bpp to be specified.
  <item>A `-nolock' server command-line option has been added to allow
	the server's locking mechanism to be disabled.
  <item>All VGA cards with a set of discrete clocks (i.e. not a ClockChip or
	a ClockProg) can now also use all the clocks mentioned in the
	clocks line divided by 2.  This presents the server with twice as
	many clocks to choose from.  Add the option "clkdiv2" to the "Device"
	section of XF86Config to enable this.
  <item>Some cursor colouring bugs have been fixed for servers that use
	hardware cursors.
  <item>A security problem related to the X server's lock files has been
	fixed.
  <item>The VidMode extension (as used by xvidtune) now by default only allows
	changes to modes by clients using a local connection type.  There is
	also an option to completely disable mode changes via this extension.
  <item>A new server extension called "XFree86-Misc" has been added.  The
	primary purpose of this is to allow reconfiguration of some parameters	
	while the server is running.  Some functions previously in the
	VidMode extension (like screen save functions) have been moved to
	this new extension.
  <item>Support has been added for the ALPS GlidePoint.  A tap on the pad
	is treated as a fourth button.
  <item>The XKEYBOARD extension is included in the servers as part of X11R6.1.
	It is enabled by default, but can be disabled either from the command
	line (see the Xserver man page) or from the XF86Config file
	(see XkbDisable in the XF86Config man page).  With this extension
	enabled, you may see some differences in the keyboard mappings.
  <item>A new extension called XFree86-DGA is now provided.  This allows
	a client program to get direct access to the video card's memory.
	This is implemented for most of the servers/drivers that can support
	it.  Connections are only allowed from clients using a local
	connection type (e.g., DISPLAY=":0").
	For details
	of the client-side API, see the XF86DGA(3) man page, and the file
	README.DGA.
  <item>An implementation of the XInput extension is now included.  It
	has support for the following devices:
	<itemize>
	  <item>Joystick (Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD only)
	  <item>Wacom tablet (Wacom IV protocol only)
	  <item>Elographics touchscreen
	  <item>SummaSketch tablet
	  <item>Mouse
	</itemize>
	Refer to the XF86Config(4/5) manual page and the <htmlurl
	name="xinput document" url="xinput.html"> for configuration details.
  <item>The default black and white pixel values are now black = 0 and
	white = 1 for all servers.  This may be swapped with the
	`-flipPixels' command-line option.
  <item>Underscore characters are now ignored in Options and keywords in the 
	XF86Config file.
  <item>The built-in X server malloc is used by default.
  <item>A problem that can cause the X server to crash when running
	xvidtune has been fixed.
  <item>Bitmap fontpath elements can have <tt>&dquot;:unscaled&dquot;</tt>
	appended to prevent the fonts from being treated as scalable.  This
	works with the fontserver (xfs) too.
  <item>*The PEX and XIE server extensions can now be dynamically loaded
	for Linux/ELF, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
</itemize>
<sect1> XF86Setup
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>3.2 includes a new, graphical utility for X server configuration
	called `XF86Setup'.  NOTE: this utility requires that you have the
	VGA16 server installed, as well as the server specific to your
	video card.
</itemize>
<sect1> PC98 Support
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support has been added for PC98 machines.  These are Intel based
	machines which are common in Japan.
  <item>Support has been added for the PANIX-PC98 SVR4.0 OS.
  <item>The following PC98-specific X servers are included:
	<itemize>
	  <item>XF98_NECS3 PC98 NEC(S3) server.
	  <item>XF98_PWSKB SKB-PowerWindow(S3) server.
	  <item>XF98_PWLB  PC98 PowerWindowLB(S3) server.

  <item>XInput drivers are now dynamically loadable for Linux/ELF, FreeBSD,
	and NetBSD.
  <item>Multiple instances of XInput devices may be specified.
</itemize>
<sect1> S3 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for the S3 Trio64V+.
  <item>*New server (XF86_S3V) for the S3 ViRGE and ViRGE/VX.  Note that this
	server is very new, and is considered "beta".  Please report any
	problems with it.
  <item>Support in the S3 server for the AT&amp;T 20C409 and 20C499 RAMDACs.
  <item>Some potential problems with the way the accelerator is used have
	been fixed.
  <item>A new driver has been added for the 868/968/Trio64V+ which uses
	the new MMIO mode available with these chips.  This new driver is
	used by default for these chips on Intel platforms, but not yet
	on Alpha platforms.  It can be enabled for Alpha platforms by 
	specifying:
	<verb>
	Chipset "NewMMio"
	</verb>
	If you see any problems with the new driver, please let us know.
	It is possible to
	disable this new driver and use the old one by specifying:
	<verb>
	Chipset "mmio_928"
	</verb>
	in the Device section.  Please test the new driver before
	disabling it, and for any problem you see, also check if it happens
	with the old driver, and let us know (even if the old driver fixes
	the problem!).
  <item>An initialisation problem with some VideoLogic cards has been fixed.
  <item>Support for the ELSA Winner 2000PRO/X rev G and ELSA Gloria-8 (except
	the GLint 300SX 3D chip) has been added.
  <item>Problems with S3 dashed lines are fixed.
  <item>Added options "slow_dram" and "slow_edodram" to avoid pixel
	errors on the display for some broken cards.
  <item>A Ti3026 clock problem that appears on some SPEA cards has been fixed.
  <item>Code has been added to automatically detect the Trio32 bug that causes
	font cache problems.  When detected, a workaround is activated..
  <item>Framebuffer address problems with some 1MB Trio64 VLB cards should
	be fixed.
  <item>The low ICS5342 clock limit has been removed.
  <item>Detection of Diamond S3 cards has been improved.  If you've needed
	to use the "diamond" option to avoid screen wrapping in previous
	releases, try removing it and let us know if there are any problems.
  <item>Memory parameter calculations for 2MB Trio64 cards have been fixed.
	If you've needed to add something like "S3MClk 170" to your
	XF86Config with previous versions, you should remove it now.
  <item>The handling of the S3RefClk XF86Config setting has been fixed
	for cards with an IBM Ramdac.
  <item>Support for S3 and Bt485 HW cursor in doublescan modes.
  <item>Fix positioning of IBM RGB Ramdac HW cursor in interlace and
	doublescan modes (the cursor shape still isn't correct).
  <item>Improved linear fb detection for PCI cards.  In particular this
	should allow most Trio64V+ cards to use the linear fb, which
	seems to prevent a lot of the lockups that have been reported.
  <item>Support for the ELSA Elsa Winner2000PRO/X-2,4 Rev.G which uses
	an ICS9161A clock chip as well as the Ti3026 RAMDAC (clock
	doubling not supported yet).
  <item>The default InvertVCLK settings have been changed for &num;9 Motion
	771 cards and Hercules Terminator 64 Pro cards.  If you have
	needed to add Invert_VCLK lines to your XF86Config file to avoid
	screen wrapping with version 3.1.2, please remove them when
	testing this version.  If there are problems with the new
	defaults, please report them to us.
  <item>*Text clipping performance has been improved.
</itemize>
<sect1> Mach64 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Most problems in the handling of block_write have been fixed.  
	Nevertheless, you still might need to add the "no_block_write" option
	to your XF86Config if the BIOS doesn't correctly initialise the
	chip.
  <item>Screen blanking for some Mach64 CT cards running at 16bpp and 32bpp
	has been fixed.  Problems remain for some revisions of the CT chip.
  <item>The Mach64 server supports the VT and GT chipset.  The GT is also
	known as "3D Rage".  The newer 3D Rage II is not yet supported.
  <item>A problem with ol[v]wm icons has been fixed.
  <item>A problem with ghostview scrollbars has been fixed.  This may also
	fix some Netscape font problems that have been reported.
  <item>The Mach64 CT (also known as the 264CT or 215CT22200) chip is now
	supported.  This chip has a integrated RAMDAC and clockchip, and
	is used on some Graphics Xpression and WinBoost cards.
  <item>The Mach64 GX-F (GX rev 3) is now supported.
  <item>The IBM RGB514 RAMDAC is now supported (as used on the ATI
	Graphics Turbo Pro 1600).
  <item>The memory base should now be correctly detected for VLB cards.
	If you've needed to add a `MemBase' line to the XF86Config for
	previous versions, please try removing it, and let us know if there
	are any problems.
  <item>Cursor colour problems at 16bpp/32bpp mode with some RAMDACs have
	been fixed.
  <item>Errors in detecting some RAMDACs (like the CH8398) should now be
	fixed.
  <item>8 bit-per-RGB mode (when running at 8bpp) is now the default for
	RAMDACs that support it.
  <item>Hardware cursor mask problem has been fixed.
  <item>Support for the AT&amp;T 20C408 RAMDAC/Clockchip has been added.
  <item>Arbitrary clocks can be used on most cards with supported clock chips.
  <item>Hardware cursor color problem on Mach64 CT, VT and GT chips at 16bpp
	and 32bpp has been fixed.
  <item>Doublescan mode is supported on VT and GT chipsets.  The hardware
	cursor is not correctly displayed in doublescan modes, but functions
	correctly.  No other Mach64 chipsets can support an accelerated
	doublescan mode.
  <item>Video noise on certain CT, VT and GT chips has been eliminated (on
	nearly all cards) or reduced as much as possible (on certain CT
	based cards).
  <item>Clock chip programming accuracy has been greatly improved on CT, ET,
	VT and GT based cards.  This may result in modes that were set up
	for a previous release not being displayed as before.  With the
	xvidtune program, you can adjust the screen to work with the now
	correct clock programming.
  <item>*The reliability of the Mach64 detection code has been improved.
</itemize>
<sect1> Mach32 server
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Hardware cursor mask problem has been fixed.

  <item>Support for the STG1703 RAMDAC/clock has been added.  Clocks up to
	135MHz should be OK.  To use the programmable clock add the
	following line to the Device section of the XF86Config:
	<tscreen><verb>
	ClockChip "stg1703"
	</verb></tscreen>
  <item>Options have been added to allow PCI burst mode and W32 interleaving
	to be turned on or off.  The XF86Config Device section entries
	for these are:
	<tscreen><verb>

  <item>The Hercules mono driver has been disabled in this release because
	it has problems, and isn't likely to be fixed soon.
</itemize>
<sect1> Client/Library changes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>Support for most vt220/vt320 escape sequenced has been added to xterm.
  <item>Support for ddterm's escape sequences has been added to xterm.
  <item>The termcap and terminfo entries for xterm have been updated in line
	with the new features present.  These entries are not completely
	compatible with earlier versions of xterm.
  <item>xdm's session handling on BSD OSs has been fixed.
  <item>Some buffer overrun problems which can lead to security problems
	have been fixed in libXt and libX11.  At least one of these
	problems has been used to exploit the setuid xterm.
  <item>POSIX termios support has been added for xterm on most BSD systems.
	This removes the need for the BSD kernel to built with the
	COMPAT_43 option.
  <item>As part of the change to X11R6.1, the shared library revisions
	for libX11, libXaw, libXext, and libXtst have been incremented
	to 6.1.
  <item>The client-side library code for the XFree86 extensions and the
	ScreenSaver extension has been moved into separate libraries.
	The old libXExExt has been removed.
  <item>Colour support is now included by default in xterm.  I18N support
	in xterm has been improved (as part of X11R6.1).  If you've previously
	been using one of the many "color_xterm" variants, try this and let
	us know if you have any problems.
  <item>xdpyinfo has been updated to provide more detailed information
	about the XInput extension and the XFree86 extensions.
  <item>The setting/examining of extended screen saver parameters has
	been added to xset (was in xvidtune).  xset can now also be used
	to set the keyboard repeat parameters.
  <item>The following new clients have been added:
	<itemize>
	  <item>dga -- a test program for the XFree86-DGA extension.
	  <item>xsetmode, xsetpointer -- programs for use with the XInput
		extension.
	</itemize>
  <item>The xdm security fix from the X Consortium's R6 fix-13 is included.
  <item>xconsole has been updated for Unixware 2.x.
  <item>XNLS support has been added for KOI8-R.
  <item>xrdb dynamically allocates string space to avoid overruns.
  <item>A memory overrun problem in xterm has been fixed.
  <item>An "AllowNullPasswd" resource has been added to xdm.

The upgrade to version 3.1.2E will overwrite some files from the 3.1.2D
installation.  It is recommended that you <bf>MAKE A BACKUP OF</bf>
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> <bf>BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE</bf>.

To upgrade from 3.1.2D to 3.1.2E, first extract the X312Eupd.tgz and
X312Edoc.tgz files as root from the <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> directory:

<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	gzip -d < X312Eupd.tgz | tar vxf -
	gzip -d < X312Edoc.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>

Next, extract the server(s) you need from the same directory.  For example,
to extract the S3 and SVGA and Xnest servers, run:

<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	gzip -d < X312ES3.tgz | tar vxf -
	gzip -d < X312ESVGA.tgz | tar vxf -
	gzip -d < X312Enest.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>

Note that there is no postinst.sh script to be run for this release.
However, if you didn't install <tt>X312Dfnon.tgz</tt> when installing
3.1.2D (or are not sure if you installed it), you should run the following:

<tscreen><verb>
	/usr/X11R6/bin/mkfontdir /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
</verb></tscreen>
 
An up-to-date version of the xterm termcap and terminfo entries is
included in the 3.1.2E update.  The files get installed in
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc</tt>.  To make use of these, you need to
manually update your system's termcap or terminfo database.  If your
system uses termcap, find the <tt>termcap</tt> file (it may be in
<tt>/etc</tt> or somewhere under <tt>/usr/share</tt>), comment out the
existing xterm entries, and add the new ones (which are in
<tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/xterm.termcap</tt>).  If your system uses
terminfo, the new entries can be installed by running:

<tscreen><verb>
	tic /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/xterm.terminfo
</verb></tscreen>

Note: on some systems (including Linux), you may first need to remove
some existing terminfo entries if <tt>tic</tt> complains about duplicates.
For example:

<tscreen><verb>
	rm /usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterms
	rm /usr/lib/terminfo/v/vs100
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Installing the XFree86 3.2 Release
<p>
The XFree86 3.2 binary release is distributed as a full release,
not as an upgrade.

What follows is a list of the XFree86 3.2 components.  There may be
some variations in this for some OSs.

The following are required for all installations:
<quote>
<verb>
preinst.sh      Pre-installation script
postinst.sh     Post-installation script
X32bin.tgz      Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
X32doc.tgz      Documentation
X32fnts.tgz     75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
X32lib.tgz      Data files required at run-time
X32man.tgz      Manual pages
X32set.tgz      XF86Setup utility
X32VG16.tgz     16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)
</verb>
</quote>

The following is required for new installations, and optional for existing
installations:
<quote>
<verb>
X32cfg.tgz     sample config files for xinit, xdm
</verb>
</quote>

NOTE: Be very careful about installing X32cfg.tgz over an existing
installation if you have customised your xinit and/or xdm config files.
Installing X32cfg.tgz will overwrite any existing files.  If you do have
customised files, there is no need to install X32cfg.tgz.

The following X servers are for PC/AT hardware.  Choose at least one which
matches your hardware, as well as the VGA16 server.  The VGA16 server is
required by the new configuration utility (XF86Setup).

If you already have a version of XFree86 installed, <bf>MAKE A BACKUP OF</bf>
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> <bf>BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE</bf>.  The standard
installation procedure will overwrite your existing version of XFree86.

If you are installing from scratch, create a directory called
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, then extract the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files.
If you don't have enough space in <tt>/usr</tt> for this, create a
directory elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it.
E.g., if you create a directory in <tt>/home</tt>:
<tscreen><verb>
	mkdir /home/X11R6
	ln -s /home/X11R6 /usr
</verb></tscreen>

The next step is to run the pre-installation script.  This script makes
some preliminary checks of your system.  For some OSs, it may tell you
to install new versions of some system components before proceeding with
the installation.  This script also removes outdated files and symbolic
links from a previous installation that may cause problems.

Copy the <tt>preinst.sh</tt> script to
<tt>/var/tmp</tt>, then go to <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and run it:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

The <tt>.tgz</tt> files are gzipped tar files.  To extract them, go to
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt>, and run the following as <bf>root</bf> for each
file you need:
<tscreen><verb>
	gzip -d < X32file.tgz | tar vxf -
</verb></tscreen>
On some OSs, you might get some "Broken Pipe" messages.  Providing there
are no other messages associated with this, they can be safely ignored.
Note: You should not be running X while doing this installation.  Doing
so may cause the installation to fail, or cause your X session to crash.

If you are using NetBSD or FreeBSD, a more reliable (and highly recommended)
way of doing this is to extract the <tt>.tgz</tt> files with:
<tscreen><verb>
        gzip -d < X32file.tgz | tar -v -x --unlink -f -
</verb></tscreen>

If you have GNU cpio (as Linux does) or SVR4 cpio, a more reliable (and
highly recommended) way of doing this is to extract the <tt>.tgz</tt>
files with:
<tscreen><verb>
	gzip -d < X32file.tgz | cpio -i -v -d -u -H ustar
</verb></tscreen>

Once the required <tt>.tgz</tt> files have been extracted, copy the
<tt>postinst.sh</tt> script to <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, then go to
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and run it:
<tscreen><verb>
	cd /usr/X11R6
	sh /var/tmp/postinst.sh
</verb></tscreen>

For OSs which use ldconfig (like Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD), you
should either run ldconfig or reboot to complete the installation.
On FreeBSD and NetBSD, ldconfig takes arguments.  In particular, you should
at least include <tt>/usr/lib</tt> and <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib</tt> on the
command line.  Check <tt>/etc/rc</tt> to see how ldconfig gets run at
boot time.
