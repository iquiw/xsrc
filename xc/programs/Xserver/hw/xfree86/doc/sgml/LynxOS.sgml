<toc>

<sect>What and Where is XFree86?<p>
XFree86 is a port of X11R6.1 that supports several versions of
Intel-based Unix.  It is derived from X386 1.2, which was the X server
distributed with X11R5.  This release consists of many new features
and performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.  The release
is available as source patches against the X Consortium X11R6.1 code, as
well as binary distributions for many architectures.

See the Copyright Notice in <url url="COPYRIGHT.html" name="Copyright Notice">.

The sources for XFree86 are available by anonymous ftp from:

<url name="ftp.XFree86.org:/pub/XFree86/current"
url="ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/current">

Binaries for the 3.2 release on LynxOS AT are available from:

<url name="ftp.XFree86.org:/pub/XFree86/current/binaries/LynxOS"
url="ftp://ftp.XFree86.org/pub/XFree86/current/binaries/LynxOS">
 
The XFree86 LynxOS port was developed using `LynxOS AT 2.3.0 080695-A FCS'
and later `LynxOS AT 2.4.0 042696'. XFree86 versions later than 3.1.2
have not been tested on LynxOS versions earlier than 2.3.0. The binaries 
are built on `LynxOS AT 2.4.0 042696'.

XFree86 supports LynxOS on the AT, on the microSPARC and
on the PowerPC platform. X servers are currently available on
the AT and microSPARC platform. Refer to section <ref id="others"
name="Building on microSPARC and PowerPC"> for details on XFree86
on the non-AT platforms.

Send email to <it>tm@systrix.de</it> (Thomas Mueller) or
<it>XFree86@XFree86.org</it> if you have comments or suggestions about
this file and we'll revise it.

<sect>Installing the Binaries
<p>
The binary distribution is composed of a number of  tar archives
which are the executables, servers, fonts, libraries, include files,
man pages, config files, and the server link kit.  The full distribution
takes over 80MB of disk space.  

At a minimum you need to unpack the 'required' <tt/X32*.tgz/ archives
plus at least one server that matches your vga card. If you will be
using the new <tt/XF86Setup/ utility you will also need the VGA16
server.  You'll need about 40Mb for the minimum required run-time
binaries only.

<descrip>
<tag/REQUIRED:/
    <descrip>
    <tag/X32bin/	Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
    <tag/X32doc/	Documentation
    <tag/X32fnts/	75dpi and misc fonts
    <tag/X32lib/	Data files required at run-time
    <tag/X32cfg/	sample config files for xinit, xdm
    <tag/X32set/	XF86Setup utility
    <tag/X32VG16/	16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)
    </descrip>

    Choose at least one of the following server to match your hardware:

    <descrip>
    <tag/X328514/	8514/A server
    <tag/X32AGX/	AGX server
    <tag/X32I128/	I128 server
    <tag/X32Ma64/	Mach 64 server
    <tag/X32Ma32/	Mach 32 server
    <tag/X32Ma8/	Mach 8 server
    <tag/X32Mono/	Monochrome server
    <tag/X32P9K/	P9000 server
    <tag/X32S3/		S3 server
    <tag/X32S3V/	S3 ViRGE server
    <tag/X32SVGA/	SVGA server
    <tag/X32VG16/	16 colour VGA server
    <tag/X32W32/	ET4000/W32, ET6000 server
    </descrip>

<tag/OPTIONAL:/

    <descrip>
    <tag/X32f100/ 100dpi fonts
    <tag/X32fcyr/ Cyrillic fonts
    <tag/X32fnon/ Other fonts (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew)
    <tag/X32fscl/ Scalable fonts (Speedo and Type1)
    <tag/X32fsrv/ Font server and config files
    <tag/X32prog/ X header files, config files and compile-time libs
    <tag/X32man/  Manual pages
    <tag/X32nest/ Nested X server
    </descrip>
</descrip>

If this is your first time, then you can safely install all of the
packages.  As a minimal install, you'll need doc, bin, fonts lib,
config, and one X server.

<sect1>Full Install
<p>
<enum>
<item> You must be logged in as root to unpack the archives because
     several executables are set-user-id.  Otherwise the server may
     abort if you unpack it as an ordinary user.

<item> If you have about 80Mb free in the <tt>/usr</tt> partition create
     a directory <tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> and skip to no. 3.
     Otherwise, create a directory on another partition and sym link it into
     <tt>/usr</tt>:

<tscreen><verb>
 # cd /usr/local
 # mkdir X11R6
 # ln -s /usr/local/X11R6 /usr/X11R6
</verb></tscreen>

<item> Unpack everything:

     If you are using bash:

<tscreen><verb>
 # cd /usr/X11R6
 # for i in X32*.tgz; do
 #   gnutar -xzpPf $i
 # done
</verb></tscreen>

     Else, if you are using csh:
<tscreen><verb>
 % cd /usr/X11R6
 % foreach i (X32*.tgz)
 %   gnutar -xzpPf $i
 % end
</verb></tscreen>

<item> Create a symbolic link ``<tt/X/'' that points to the server
     that matches your video card.  The <em/XF86_*/ man pages list which
     vga chip sets are supported by each server.  For example, if you
     have an ET4000 based card you will use the XF86_SVGA server:

<tscreen><verb>
 # cd /usr/X11R6/bin; rm -f X; ln -s XF86_SVGA X
</verb></tscreen>
</enum>

<sect1>Minimal Install:
<p>
First do numbers 1 and 2 above. Then unpack the required archives:

<tscreen><verb>
 # cd /usr/X11R6
 # for i in bin fnts lib xicf; do
 #   gnutar -xzpPf  X32$i.tgz
 # done
</verb></tscreen>

Then unpack a server archive corresponding to your vga card.  The
server man pages, <tt>X11R6/man/man1/XF86_*</tt>, list the vga chip
sets supported by each server.  For example, if you have an ET4000
based card you will use the XF86_SVGA server:

<tscreen><verb>
 # gnutar -xzpPf X32SVGA.tgz
 # cd /usr/X11R6/bin; rm -f X; ln -s XF86_SVGA X
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>After either Full or Minimal Install above
<p>

If you had already configured <tt>X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc</tt> or
<tt>X11R6/lib/X11/xdm/*</tt> omit the <tt/xinit-config/ or
<tt/xdm-config/ archive or unpack it separately and merge in your
customizations.

The <tt/fscl/ and <tt/f100/ archives are optional and can be omitted
if you are short on space.  The optional <tt/link/ archive (not
included in beta releases) allows you to reconfigure and customize a X
server binary.

The optional <tt/prog/ archive is needed only for writing or compiling
X applications. Before building programs check wether
<tt>X11R6/lib/X11/config/lynx.cf</tt> has correct settings for
OSMajorVersion, OSMinorVersion and OSTeenyVersion for your operating
system version.

Refer to section <ref id="running" name="Running XFree86"> for further
information on necessary configuration steps before running XFree86 on
LynxOS.

<sect>Compiling the XFree86 Distribution<p>
<sect1>Disk space requirements<p>
Currently there is no support for shared libraries in the LynxOS
XFree86 port. A complete binary installation along with manual pages
will require approximately 70-90 MBytes of disk space. To compile
the system you will need at least 230 MBytes of free disk space.

<sect1>Changes to system environment<p>
Before compiling the XFree86 distribution you will have to make a
few little adjustments to your system:

  <descrip>
  <tag>LynxOS AT 2.3 and 2.4</tag>
  <itemize>
  <item> Use the CYGNUS GNU-C Compiler to build XFree86. With LynxOS 2.3.0 
    and 2.4.0 you must execute the shell script <tt>/CYGNUS.bash</tt> to 
    apply the necessary changes to your environment.
  <item> Create a shell script named /lib/cpp as follows:
  <tscreen><verb>
    #!/bin/sh
    /cygnus/94q4-lynxos-x86/lib/gcc-lib/i386-lynx/2.6-94q4/cpp \
	      -traditional "$@"
  </verb></tscreen>
    It is possible that future releases use a different path for
    the CYGNUS compiler support programs. You may use
  <tscreen><verb>
	gcc -v
  </verb></tscreen>
    to find out the correct path. Set the file mode of /lib/cpp with
  <tscreen><verb>
        # chown root /lib/cpp
	# chmod 755 /lib/cpp
  </verb></tscreen>
  </itemize>
  <tag>LynxOS AT 2.2.1</tag>
  <itemize>
  <item> Create a shell script named /lib/cpp as follows:
  <tscreen><verb>
    #!/bin/sh
    /usr/local/lib/gcc-cpp -traditional "$@"
  </verb></tscreen>
  <item> The loader /bin/ld of LynxOS 2.2.1 does not support the -L option
    which is heavily used by X11R6 makefiles. To work around this
    problem you must install a small wrapper program which replaces
    the original /bin/ld program. Use the following steps to install
    it:
  <tscreen><verb>
      # cd xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree/etc
      # cc -o ld ld-wrapper.c
      # mv /bin/ld /bin/ld.org
      # mv ld /bin/ld
      # chmod 511 /bin/ld
      # chown root /bin/ld
  </verb></tscreen>
  <item> Modify system header files as follows:
  <descrip>
    <tag><tt>/usr/include/uio.h</tt></tag> surrounded by
     <tscreen><verb>
          #ifndef _UIO_H
          #define _UIO_H
          ...
          #endif
     </verb></tscreen>
    <tag><tt>/usr/include/utmp.h</tt></tag> surrounded by
     <tscreen><verb>
          #ifndef _UTMP_H
          #define _UTMP_H
          ...
          #endif
     </verb></tscreen>
    <tag><tt>/usr/include/unistd.h</tt></tag> add
     <tscreen><verb>
          extern int read();
     </verb></tscreen>
    </descrip>
  </itemize>
  </descrip>

<sect1> make World<p>

  Before you start compilation you must edit <tt>xc/config/cf/lynx.cf</tt> to
  match your operating system version. Change the definitions of
  OSMajorVersion, OSMinorVersion and OSTeenyVersion accordingly.

  You may now issue a

  <tscreen><verb>
     make World
  </verb></tscreen>

  to compile XFree86. After a few hours (and hopefully a successful
  build of the XFree86 system) you can install the software using

  <tscreen><verb>
     make install
  </verb></tscreen>

  You must be logged in as super-user (root) when you invoke `make
  install'.  Be sure to set your environment to use the same compiler
  (LynxOS 2.3.0/2.4.0, CYGNUS GNU-C) as you did during the `make World'. To
  install the LinkKit use

  <tscreen><verb>
     make install.linkkit
  </verb></tscreen>

  With LynxOS 2.2.1 programs will not be stripped during
  installation. This is due to a problem with the strip program which
  shows up when installing across file system boundaries.

  Refer to section <ref id="installman" name="Installing XFree86 manual pages"> 
  for manual page installation.

<sect>Running XFree86<p><label id="running">
<sect1>System requirements<p>
  A minimum of 8MB of memory is required to run X. If you want to run
  real-world applications you should think of upgrading to 16MB. If
  you plan to develop software under X take 32MB into consideration.

<sect1>System tuning<p>
<sect2>Tunable parameters<p>

  To run XFree86 reasonably you must adjust a few system parameters in
  <tt>/usr/include/param.h</tt>:

<verb>
  Tunable					        Old	New
  USR_NFDS	number of open files per process	 20	 64
  NPROC		number of tasks				 50	150
  NFILES	number of open files in system		100	250
  NINODES	number of incore inodes			(same value as NFILES)
  QUANTUM	clock ticks until preemption		 64      20
  CACHEBLKS	number of cache memory blocks		202	 >= 4096
</verb>

  The new values are those suggested by the LynxOS documentation for
  their X Window package.

<sect2>Increase number of ptys<p>

  You should also increase the number of ptys to be able run a couple
  more xterms. You may replace <tt>/sys/lynx.os/pty.cfg</tt> with
  <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/pty.cfg</tt>.

<sect2>Kernel build<p>

  If you plan to use PS/2 or Bus mice refer to the following section
  before rebuilding the kernel, if not, you should rebuild the kernel
  now: 

  <tscreen><verb>
     # cd /sys/lynx.os
     # make install
     # reboot -N
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Bus mouse drivers<p>

  Starting with LynxOS AT 2.4.4 LynxOS includes a PS/2 mouse driver.
  Currently this driver is not supported by XFree86.
  <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/BM-Lynx.shar</tt> contains a port 
  of the Linux drivers for those devices. To install the drivers
  unpack the shar archive

  <tscreen><verb>
    # cd /
    # bash /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc/BM-Lynx.shar
  </verb></tscreen>

  and follow the notes in <tt>/BMOUSE.Readme</tt> for further installation and
  configuration notes.

  The XFree86 PS/2 mouse driver works also with MetroLink X 2.3.3.1 as
  shipped with LynxOS AT 2.4.0 unless you have the LynxOS patch
  000055-00 installed.  <sect1> ATC console driver and VT switching<p>

  The XFree86 servers will only run with the default LynxOS console
  driver, sorry for those of you who use the alternative vdt console
  driver. Currently there is no support for virtual terminal switching
  once the server has started.

  You will need a free console which the X server will use for
  keyboard input. You must disable login on at least one of the four
  virtual terminals in /etc/ttys, e.g. /dev/atc3:

  <tscreen>
    change
  <verb>
       /dev/atc3:1:default:vt100at:/bin/login
  </verb>
    to
  <verb>
       /dev/atc3:0:default:vt100at:/bin/login
                 ^
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect1>X Server debug diagnostics output and other VT peculiarities<p>

  The XFree86 X servers will produce a lot of diagnostics output on
  stderr during startup. This output will be lost after the server
  reached a certain point in its console initialization process. You
  should redirect stdout and stderr if you want to analyze the
  diagnostics produced by the server.

  When the X server is running output made to other consoles will be
  lost. After server shutdown the screen contents of other consoles
  may be inconsistent with what one would expect (i.e. random).

<sect>Installing XFree86 manual pages<p><label id="installman">

  LynxOS uses cat-able manual pages, and because a doc preparation
  system is definitely not a vital component of a real-time operating
  system you must first install groff-1.09. Starting with LynxOS 2.3.0 it
  compiles right out of the box (or better tar archive).

  XFree86 manual pages may be installed using

  <tscreen><verb>
     make install.man
  </verb></tscreen>

  The index and whatis database for the XFree86 manual pages will be
  created automatically. If you already have a whatis database or
  index file in the destination directories you should perform a
  sort/uniq operation to remove duplicate entries:

  <tscreen><verb>
     for i in 1 3 5
     do
       rm -f /tmp/tmpfile
       sort /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/LIST$i | uniq > /tmp/tmpfile
       mv /tmp/tmpfile /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/LIST$i
     done
     sort /usr/X11R6/man/whatis | uniq > /tmp/tmpfile
     mv /tmp/tmpfile /usr/X11R6/man/whatis
  </verb></tscreen>
  
  With LynxOS 2.3.0 you should include <tt>/usr/X11R6/man</tt> in the MANPATH
  environment variable.

  <tscreen>
      bash:   <tt>MANPATH=&dollar;MANPATH:/usr/X11R6/man</tt>
  </tscreen>

  The /bin/man command of LynxOS 2.2.1 does not support the MANPATH
  environment variable properly. The XFree86 manual pages must be
  copied (or linked) to the standard manual page locations
  (<tt>/usr/man/catx</tt>) in  order to be read the man command:

  <tscreen><verb>
      for i in 1 3 5
      do
        ln -s /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/*.* /usr/man/cat$i
	cat /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/LIST$i >> /usr/man/cat$i/LIST$i
	sort -o /usr/man/cat$i/LIST$i /usr/man/cat$i/LIST$i
	cat /usr/X11R6/man/cat$i/whatis$i >> /usr/man/whatis
      done
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect>Using XFree86 with Motif<p>

  The Motif libraries shipped with LynxOS AT 2.3.0 and 2.4.0 can be
  used with the XFree86 libraries. Follow the steps outlined below after
  you have installed XFree86 and LynxOS Motif on your system.

<sect1>Copy Motif files<p>

  You must create symbolic links for the Motif libraries and 
  utilities in the /usr/X11R6 directory tree.
  <tscreen><verb>
      ln -s /usr/bin/X11/uil /usr/X11R6/bin
      ln -s /usr/lib/libUil.a /usr/X11R6/lib
      ln -s /usr/lib/libMrm.a /usr/X11R6/lib
      ln -s /usr/lib/X11/uid /usr/X11R6/lib/X11
      ln -s /usr/include/Xm /usr/X11R6/include
      ln -s /usr/include/Mrm /usr/X11R6/include
      ln -s /usr/include/uil /usr/X11R6/include
  </verb></tscreen>

  The Motif imake-configuration files are part of the LynxOS X Window
  package. They must be copied to the /usr/X11R6 directory tree.
  <tscreen><verb>
      cp /usr/lib/X11/config/Motif.* /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Motif library patch<p>

  The XFree86 libraries are compiled with the -mposix compiler option
  while the Motif libraries shipped with LynxOS AT 2.3.0 are not. This
  incompatibility will cause Motif XmFileSelection widgets to be linked 
  with the wrong (i.e. POSIX) directory routines. To circumvent this 
  problem apply the following patch to the library:
  <tscreen><verb>
      cp /usr/lib/libXm.a /usr/X11R6/lib
      ar x /usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.a Xmos.o
      ar x /lib/libc.a directory.s.o
      ld -r -o x.o Xmos.o directory.s.o
      mv x.o Xmos.o
      ar r /usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.a Xmos.o
  </verb></tscreen>
  
  This patch is not necessary for LynxOS 2.4.0 since POSIX support is
  now the default for the CYGNUS compiler.

<sect1>X11R6 config file patch<p>

  Edit <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/lynx.cf</tt> and change the definition
  of <tt>HasMotif</tt>
  <tscreen>
    from
  <verb>
       #define HasMotif    NO
  </verb>
    to
  <verb>
       #define HasMotif    YES
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Motif config file patch<p>

  The file <tt>Motif.tmpl</tt> shipped with LynxOS Motif must be modified
  to work with XFree86. In every reference to <tt>UnsharedLibReferences</tt>
  the first argument must be changed
  <tscreen>
    from
  <verb>
       UnsharedLibReferences(<Something>LIB, Arg2, Arg3)
  </verb>
    to
  <verb>
       UnsharedLibReferences(<Something>, Arg2, Arg3)
  </verb></tscreen>
  Be sure to apply the change to the file copied to
  <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config</tt>.

<sect>Building on microSPARC and PowerPC<label id="others"><p>

  XFree86 3.2 also compiles on LynxOS microSPARC and on LynxOS PPC. On the
  microSPARC there is X server support for the colour frame buffers CG3 and CG6
  while on the PPC there is no X server available at this time. Before you 
  start the build you must create a symbolic link from the CYGNUS gcc to a 
  file named <tt>cc</tt> somewhere in a directory included in your PATH 
  environment variable.

<sect1>Console driver patch for microSPARC<p>

  Before building on the microSPARC you should install the patch for the console
  driver supplied in <tt>xc/programs/Xserver/hw/sunLynx/patch.Console</tt>.
  The patch fixes minor problems in the original LynxOS driver and adds 
  functionalities to detect the keyboard type and control the key click.
  To create a backup of the original driver and install the patch issue 
  the commands
<tscreen><verb>
 # cd /
 # tar cf /sys/drivers/console.tar /sys/drivers/console
 # patch -p -E < xc/programs/Xserver/hw/sunLynx/patch.Console
 # cd /sys/drivers/console
 # make install
 # cd /sys/lynx.os
 # make install
 # reboot -a
</verb></tscreen>

  If you opt not to install the patch you must edit <tt>xc/config/cf/lynx.cf</tt>
  and change the definition of <tt>SparcConsoleDefines</tt>
  <tscreen>
    from
  <verb>
       #define SparcConsoleDefines    -DPATCHED_CONSOLE
  </verb>
    to
  <verb>
       #define SparcConsoleDefines    /* -DPATCHED_CONSOLE */
  </verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Known Bug of the microSPARC server<p>

  On the first start of the X server on the microSPARC you will notice that
  the pointer follows mouse movements with a certain delay (especially if
  you're moving the mouse real fast). You will also notice that moving 
  windows with certain window managers (eg mwm) is not working correctly. 
  These effects should go away on the next server start.

  The server for monochrome cards builds properly if you enable it in
  <tt>lynx.cf</tt> but it has never been tested.
