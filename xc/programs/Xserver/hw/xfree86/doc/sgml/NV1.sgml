<sect>XFree86 driver for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 and Riva128
<p>
This driver supports good acceleration for both the NV1/STG2000 as well as
the Riva128. It is known to work on PCI and AGP versions of the Riva128.

<sect1>Notes
<p>
<itemize>
  <item>On the NV1/STG2000, the driver does not support the virtual desktop 
        features of xfree86.
	This is because the NV1 does not have the necessary hardware to
	support this
	feature. If you want to change resolutions, you will have
	to modify your config file. Comment out all but the mode you wish
	to use.
  <item>The generic VGA16 server will not work with the NV1.  For this reason
	<tt>XF86Setup</tt> cannot be used to configure the server.  Use
	<tt>xf86config</tt> instead.  Select `Diamond Edge 3D' as your board,
	and select only <bf>ONE</bf> mode for each of 8bpp and 16bpp.  Do
	not select a virtual desktop.  Also, make sure you don't select
	a RAMDAC or clock chip. This does not apply if you own a Riva128
	card, as the VGA16 server works just fine on that.
  <item>Both the NV1 and the Riva128 only support a 555 RGB Weight in 16 bpp, 
        the hardware does
	not do 565. If you run into problems with some window managers in
	16bpp, try putting a Weight 555 in the Display section.
  <item>24 bpp is not supported.
  <item>In some modes the hardware cursor gets out of sync with the display.
        Use Option "sw_cursor" to work around this problem.
  <item>There are modelines that confuse the Riva128 chip. This results in
        a greenish display. Slightly modifying the modeline usually fixes 
	the problem. In most cases all that is needed is to reduce the
	HTotal. You can use xvidtune to do that.
  <item>The dotclock limits for this driver seem to be lower than the
        hardware specs (and drivers for other graphical user interfaces) seem
	to indicate. If you get a flickery screen with flashes, try to limit
	the modes you use to about 160MHz in 16bpp and about 100MHz in 32bpp.
