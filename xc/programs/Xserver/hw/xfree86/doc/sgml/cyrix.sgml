<sect>Supported hardware <p>

This driver (as used in the SVGA (VGA256), VGA16 and VGA_Mono servers) 
supports a single chipset `mediagx' that should work on the following Cyrix
CPUs with integrated graphics:

<itemize>
<item>MediaGX
<item>MediaGXi
<item>MediaGXm
</itemize>

<sect>Features <p>
<itemize>
<item>accelerated
<item>hardware cursor
<item>support color depths 1, 4, 8 and 16
</itemize>

<sect>XF86Config Option <p>
<descrip>
<tag>Option "sw_cursor"</tag>
disable the hardware cursor.
<tag>Option "no_accel"</tag>
completely disables acceleration. Usually not recommended.
</descrip>

<sect>Bugs and Limitations<p>
<itemize>
<item>On some older chipsets, the driver may trigger an illegal instruction
just after probing for the ``scratchpad size''.  If this is the case,
email to Annius.Groenink@cwi.nl with the output of 
<verb>
XF86_SVGA -probeonly -verbose
</verb>
and this will be fixed.
<item>There are limitations to the modeline values that can be specified.
Particularly, the difference between the first two horizontal
timings (e.g. 640 656, 1024 1048) must be at least 16 and at most 24.
<item>The 4 colour server is slow due to the VGA banking mode used.
Moreover,
it does not work the way it is run by XF86Setup, which is probably
due to the timing limitations.
</itemize>
