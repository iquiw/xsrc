Remaining bugs:

Using a Motif textbox leaves artifacts on alpha, and possibly mips 8-bit
color. Works fine on mips with 32-bit color. pxDoFillSpansUS() and/or raw
scanline routines are the suspects.

Xaw text boxes have artifacts sometimes.

The PixelStamp's sloped lines are off; need to draw them the hard way.
