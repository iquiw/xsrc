$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.2 2001/09/22 19:43:49 ad Exp $

-- Remaining bugs

Using a Motif textbox leaves artifacts on alpha, and possibly mips 8-bit
color. Works fine on mips with 32-bit color. pxDoFillSpansUS() and/or raw
scanline routines are the suspects.

software cursor leaves a trail of rubbish. scanline routines?

Some glyphs are slightly garbled on mips in 32-bit color mode. Same problem
doesn't exist on alpha. Problem: the glyph routines, both TE and non-TE.

-- TODO, in order of priority

- MIPS and Alpha assembly versions of compress/expand routines
- Redo cfb stacking
- Compile with -Wall and clear up compiler warnings
- Look at hardware clip rectangles again and use
- Stippled PushPixels (important for Motif menus)
- Unnatural stippled spans with XYMASKs
- Full-blown tiling should be a combo of WRITE and COPY
- Figure out why queueing doesn't work
- Make i860 firmware work
