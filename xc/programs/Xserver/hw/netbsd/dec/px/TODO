-- Remaining bugs

Using a Motif textbox leaves artifacts on alpha, and possibly mips 8-bit
color. Works fine on mips with 32-bit color. pxDoFillSpansUS() and/or raw
scanline routines are the suspects.

Software cursor leaves a trail of rubbish.

PushPixels() is broken on mips, works fine on alpha.

-- Possible optimisations

- MIPS and Alpha assembly versions of compress/expand routines
- Stippled PushPixels (important for Motif menus, no joke)
- Unnatural stippled spans with XYMASKs
- Full-blown tiling should be a combo of WRITE and COPY
- Figure out why queueing doesn't work
- Make i860 firmware work
