The X Keyboard extension is neither a standard nor a draft standard of the
X Consortium, is known to need some additional design and/or implementation
work and is still evolving, and might not be compatible with any final
standard, although we hope that what is provided will differ very little
from an eventual standard.  We are making it available in early form in
order to gather broader experimentation and feedback from those willing to
invest the time and energy, to help us produce better standards.
