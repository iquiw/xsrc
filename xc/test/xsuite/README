This file describes the software in X11 Release 6.1 of the
Xlib and X Protocol Test Suite from the X Consortium.

The main directories to be aware of initially are:

xtest/doc - This contains the documentation. It contains a user guide,
programmers guide and release notes. These are supplied in troff(1)
format requiring the mm macro package, and also in PostScript format.
You should look at the release notes and the user guide before
attempting to install and build the test suite.

xtest - This contains the tests included in the X Test Suite
which are stored as a complete TET test suite. This includes all
necessary configuration files and scenario files to enable you to use
the X test suite following the instructions in the documentation.

tet - This contains the source files and include files needed to build 
the Test Environment Toolkit (TET).

Please note that this test suite tests functionality up through X11R4, 
and has not been generally upgraded to test new functionality added since
then.  As of X11R6.1, this test suite is considered unsupported software 
by X Consortium Inc, and no further development is planned.

For those who require a more up-to-date test suite with available support, 
X/Open Company Ltd. offers VSW5, a successor to the X Consortium Test Suite.
VSW5 includes many bug fixes and a large number of new tests for Xt and 
for new R5 functionality.  R6 tests are planned for the future.  Refer
to http://www.xopen.org/public/test/vsw45.htm for more information.
