The files in this directory constitute release 1.9 of the Test Environment
Toolkit (TET) Application Programming Interface (API), C language binding.

The Makefile contains some system dependent commands (e.g. for building an
object library) in variables which should be configured correctly before
running make.

The source is written to POSIX.1-1990 using common 'C', although prototypes
for the API library functions are provided in a header file for use with
ANSI 'C' compilers.  One extension to POSIX.1 is required: the symbol NSIG.
Many UNIX systems define NSIG in <signal.h> as an extension to POSIX.1, in
which case it could be made available by compiling with another feature
test macro defined in addition to _POSIX_SOURCE.  Otherwise, the symbol
should be defined by adding -DNSIG=<value> to the compiler options in the
Makefile.  The value of NSIG should be one greater than the highest signal
number supported by the system.

After running "make all" the following files are available for use with
applications:

	tet_api.h	Header containing useful symbol definitions and
			declarations/prototypes for all API interfaces.

	tcm.o		Test Case Manager main() routine.  For processes
			to be executed by the Test Case Controller (TCC).

	tcmchild.o	Executed processes main() routine.  For processes
			to be executed by tet_exec().

	libapi.a	Library of API interfaces.

	llib-ltcm.c  )	Lint libraries defining the API interfaces.  Use 
	llib-ltcmc.c )	the one which corresponds to the object file in
			which main() is defined (tcm.o or tcmchild.o).
			They can be used directly or turned into libraries
			for use with "lint -l" by doing a "make LINTLIB"
			and installing the ".ln" files on the system.

There is also a make "INSTALL" target (the default) which copies the
object files to $(TET_ROOT)/lib/posix_c and the header file to
$(TET_ROOT)/inc/posix_c.

This release does not have any support for internationalisation.
