>>ASSERTION Good A
A call to xname returns a pixmap 
containing the bitmap-format
.S XPutImage
of the
.A data 
of depth
.A depth ,
width
.A width ,
and height
.A height ,
and with foreground and background pixel values of
.A fg
and
.A bg .
>>STRATEGY
Create a drawable for the pixmap.
Call xname to create the pixmap from the data.
Call XGetGeometry to check the pixmap.
Verify the pixmap was as expected.

>>ASSERTION Bad A
When the
.A depth
is not supported by the screen of the specified drawable
.A d ,
then on a call to xname a
.S BadValue
error occurs.
>>STRATEGY
Calculate a bad depth.
Call xname with a bad depth
Verify that a bad value error occurred.
>>CODE BadValue
XVisualInfo *vp;

/* Calculate a bad depth. */
	baddepth=1;

/* Verify that a bad value error occurred. */

>>ASSERTION Bad B 1
When sufficient temporary storage cannot be allocated, then a call to
xname returns
.S NULL .
>>ASSERTION Bad B
.ER BadAlloc 
>>ASSERTION Bad A
When a drawable argument does not name a valid drawable, then one or more
.S BadDrawable
errors, one or more
.S BadGC
errors or both types of error occur.
>>STRATEGY
Create a bad drawable by creating and destroying a window.
Call test function using bad drawable as the drawable argument.
Verify that a BadDrawable and BadGC error occurs.
>>CODE BadDrawable

	seterrdef();

	A_DRAWABLE = (Drawable)badwin(A_DISPLAY);

>>SET no-error-status-check
	XCALL;

	if (geterr() == BadDrawable || geterr() == BadGC)
