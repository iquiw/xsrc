>>TITLE XSetClipMask CH05
void
XSetClipMask(display, gc, pixmap)
Display *display = Dsp;
GC gc;
Pixmap pixmap;
>>ASSERTION Good A
A call to xname sets the
.M clip_mask
component of the specified GC to the value of the
.A pixmap
argument.
>>STRATEGY
Create window, size W_STDWIDTHxW_STDHEIGHT (>=1x1), with
	bg = background_pixel = W_BG.
Create 1x1 pixmap.
Set pixel at (0,0) in pixmap to 0.
Create GC with fg = W_FG.
Set clip_mask = pixmap with XSetClipMask
	(Note, no drawing in pixmap after XSetClipMask() call as effect on
	 subsequent clipping is undefined).
Set pixel at (0,0) to fg with XDrawPoint.
Verify pixel at (0,0) is bg using XGetImage and XGetPixel.
Create another 1x1 pixmap.
Set pixel at (0,0) in pixmap to 1.
Set clip_mask = pixmap with XSetClipMask.
Set pixel at (0,0) to fg with XDrawPoint.
Verify pixel at (0,0) is fg using XGetImage and XGetPixel.
>>CODE
XVisualInfo	*vp;
Window		win;

		FAIL;
	} else 
		CHECK;

	XFreeGC(display, gc);

	CHECKPASS(2);

>>ASSERTION Good A
When the
.A pixmap
argument is
.S None ,
then the
.M clip_mask
component of the specified
.A gc
has no effect on any subsequent graphics operation.
>>STRATEGY
Create window.
Create pixmap of window dimensions.
Create GC with clip_mask = pixmap.
Fill part of pixmap with {1,} using XFillRectangle.
Fill window using XFillRectangle.
Verify that pixels inside/outside clipping region are set to fg/bg.
Set the clip_mask to None with XSetClipMask.
Fill window using XFillRectangle.
Verify that pixels are set to fg.

>>ASSERTION Bad B 1
.ER Alloc
>>ASSERTION Bad A
.ER GC
>>ASSERTION Bad A
When the
.A pixmap
argument is a pixmap and the
.A gc
and
.A pixmap
arguments were not created for the same root, then a
.S BadMatch
error occurs.
>>STRATEGY
If alternate root window is supported:
	Create a pixmap(#1) of depth 1 for one root.
	Create a pixmap(#2) of depth 1 for alternate root.
	Created a gc for alternate root using pixmap #2.
	Verify that a call to XSetClipMask generates a BadMatch error
		when attempting to set gc's clip_mask to pixmap #1.

>>ASSERTION Bad A
When the
.A pixmap
argument does not have depth 1, then a
.S BadMatch
error occurs.
>>STRATEGY
If pixmap with depth other than one is supported:
	Create pixmap with depth other than one.
	Created gc using same root as pixmap.
	Verify that a call to XSetClipMask generates a BadMatch error.
>>CODE BadMatch
