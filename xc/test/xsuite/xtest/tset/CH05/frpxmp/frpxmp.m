>>TITLE XFreePixmap CH05
void
XFreePixmap(display, pixmap)
Display *display = Dsp;
Pixmap  pixmap;
>>ASSERTION Good A
A call to xname removes the association between the pixmap ID
.A pixmap
and the specified pixmap.
>>STRATEGY
For all supported depths of pixmap:
   Create a pixmap.
   Create a gc using the pixmap as the drawable.
   Free the pixmap with XFreePixmap.
   Plot (0,0) in the pixmap.
   Verify that a BadDrawable error occurred.
>>CODE
XGCValues	gcv;
XVisualInfo	*vp;
GC		gc;

	for(resetvinf(VI_PIX); nextvinf(&vp); ) {
		pixmap = XCreatePixmap(display, DRW(display), 1, 1, vp->depth);
		gc = makegc(display, pixmap);
		XCALL;
		
		startcall(Dsp);
		XDrawPoint(display, pixmap, gc, 0, 0);
		endcall(Dsp);
		if(geterr() != BadDrawable) {
			report("Got %s instead of BadDrawable when drawing on a freed pixmap. ", errorname(geterr()));
			FAIL;
		} else
			CHECK;
	}

	CHECKPASS(nvinf());

>>ASSERTION Good A
The storage allocated to the pixmap is not recovered until all references to it
have been removed.
>>STRATEGY
Create a window.
Create a pixmap of the same dimensions as the window.
Pattern the pixmap.
Create a gc with the pixmap as the tile and the fill_mode set to FillTiled.
Free the pixmap with XFreePixmap.
Tile the entire window with XFillRectangle.
Verify that the tiled pattern matches the pixmap.
